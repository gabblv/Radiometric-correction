**Objective**

Using dark and flat field calibration data and based on input parameters, create a solution that applies relative radiometric correction to satellite images in order to:

- Lab image: remove sensor non-uniformities as per relative radiometric correction standard
- Non-lab image: besides applying the relative radiometric correction, mitigate the effect of faulty sensor pins to improve the overall quality of the image
